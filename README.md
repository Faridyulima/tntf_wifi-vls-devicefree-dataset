# tntf_wifi-vls-devicefree-dataset
This is Wi-Fi &amp; VLS **device-free dataset** collected at Department of Nuclear Engineering and Engineering Physics, **Universitas Gadjah Mada**. The dataset is designed to support research on indoor localization, with a particular focus on multi-sensor, device-free approaches. Our objective is to develop accurate device-free location estimation methods that leverage complementary characteristics to improve performance. This work can enable niche applications, such as monitoring the well-being of elderly individuals
